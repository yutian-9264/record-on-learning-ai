1.Machine learning means a machine can study knowledge through itself instead of being input.
2.Image detection, spam detection, translation, information digest.
3.The labeled training set is the set with labeled by some characteristic.
4.
5.
6.Batch learning.
7.Instance-based learning.
8.Unsuoervised, because it does't have a specified characteristic.
9.Online learning system means the machine can learn in real-time.
10.
11.Instance-based learning.
12.Hyperparameter will affect the model very much.
13.
14.The lack of data, overfit, ...
15.solutions:train more data, use more complex model,...
16.A test set is to evaluate the model.
17.to validate whether the model is validate.
18.train-dev set is part of whole train set.you should use train-dev set to clarify whether the model is bad. You should use it before validate dev set.
19.There will be good on test set, but if cannot validate the model will perform good on more actual data.
